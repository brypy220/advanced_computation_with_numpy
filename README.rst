Advanced Computation with Numpy and N-Dimensional Arrays
====================


This project utilizes:

- Numpy's ndarrays
- Accessing individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array
- Broadcasting with ndarrays
- Linear algebra with NumPy
- Manipulating images as ndarrays







- When I first made this file `misc` was still being used instead of `datasets` and there was no dependency on `pooch`,another reason I love the industry because there is always something to learn.





Throughout the code there are various comments for my own personal use
